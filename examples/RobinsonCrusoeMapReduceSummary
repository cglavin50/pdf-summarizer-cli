In this larger piece of work, the narrator, Robinson, embarks on a series of adventures and experiences on an island over the course of many years. After surviving a shipwreck and being stranded, Robinson establishes a routine and explores the island, encountering various challenges and discovering new animals and plants. They learn to adapt to the island's seasons and establish a small farm. They also save a young goat and catch a parrot, naming it Poll. 

Over time, Robinson learns to make various items such as clothes, pots, and baskets using materials found on the island. They also successfully establish a goat population for milk and meat. However, they become fearful when they discover a human footmark on the beach and witness a disturbing scene involving cannibals. They reinforce their house and create a fence for protection. 

One day, Robinson sees a ship in the distance and finds it empty and destroyed, except for a dog. They gather useful items from the ship and bring them back to the island. They also witness cannibals killing a prisoner and decide to intervene, saving the prisoner named Friday. They develop a close relationship with Friday and teach him about European life. They plan to build a ship to return to Europe and wait until there is enough food for everyone. 

As Robinson and Friday gather materials and prepare for the shipbuilding process, they encounter more cannibals and save a European prisoner, who turns out to be Friday's father. They bring the Spanish and Friday's father back to their home and discuss the possibility of building a ship together. They decide to wait and continue expanding their resources. 

Eventually, they encounter a boat with Englishmen and witness their actions on the island. They decide to approach the Englishmen and save their prisoners. They form a plan, shoot at the guards, and convince some of the sailors to join their side. They hide the remaining sailors and discuss their next steps. 

With a group of ten men, including the captain, his assistant, and a passenger, they successfully reclaim control of a ship and celebrate their success. They decide to allow the untrustworthy prisoners to stay on the island rather than facing death in England. The group prepares for their journey off the island, bringing their belongings and meeting with the prisoners. They leave the island and visit Friday's people before heading to Europe. 

Upon arriving in London, the narrator finds everything has changed. They return to their hometown and find living relatives, while Friday finds England interesting but dislikes the cold weather. The narrator receives a letter from their wife in Brazil, revealing they have a son. Overwhelmed, they plan a visit and reunite with their wife and son. They spend time together and then decide to visit the narrator's island, only to find it inhabited by Friday's people. They decide to stay on the island and arrange for a ship to take them back to Brazil later. The narrator is fascinated by the presence of many people on their island.
