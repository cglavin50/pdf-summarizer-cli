After successfully leading the sailors away from the beach, the narrator and his group approach the three men left in the boat and convince them to surrender. They hide and wait for the sailors to return, but when the sailors find the three men missing, they become confused. The leader and two other men venture into the forest and are attacked by the captain and Friday, resulting in the leader's death and one man being injured. The remaining sailors return to the boat, where the captain convinces them to surrender. They tie up most of the prisoners but trust three of them and leave them untied. With a group of ten men, they plan to take control of the ship while the narrator and Friday stay on the island to watch the prisoners. The captain and his sailors disguise themselves as prisoners and take the boat to the ship. They inform the men on the ship that they were unable to find the others. Once all the sailors are on the ship, the captain reveals himself and the attack begins. Some sailors are injured, and the second leader of the rebellion is killed. The captain regains control of the ship and returns to the island, informing the narrator that the ship is now under his control. They celebrate their victory and the narrator's departure from the island with a feast. The captain provides the narrator with new clothes, and they discuss what to do with the five prisoners who are deemed untrustworthy. The narrator suggests giving them the choice to stay on the island, and they agree. The prisoners are placed in a cave and instructed to wait for further orders. The narrator then prepares for his journey back to Europe, deciding to take his dog, parrot, book, and valuable items from the ships. He meets with the prisoners again, showing them his corn and animals, and shares information about the island. They leave the island in December 1686 and head to the island where Friday's people live. The Spanish and Portuguese sailors are thrilled to see them and the ship, as it means they can now return to Europe without having to build a new ship. The narrator's dog reunites with its Spanish owner, resulting in an emotional meeting. Friday is given the choice to stay with his people or go to Europe, and after thinking about it, he decides to go with the narrator. They start their journey and arrive in London two months later. The narrator notices the changes in the city and people's appearance, as well as the new tools and music. He returns to his hometown of York, where he finds some living relatives who are happy to see him. Friday finds England to be a big shock but is fascinated by the new experiences. However, he dislikes the cold weather in winter. The narrator assures him that the weather is better in summer. The narrator then receives a letter from his wife in Brazil, who informs him that she has remarried and has a new family. However, her new husband has passed away, and she is now living without a husband. She also reveals that they have a son who wants to meet his father. Overwhelmed with emotions, the narrator ponders his next steps. He decides to visit Brazil to see his wife and son, and after receiving a positive response from his wife, he plans the journey. In Brazil, he reunites with his wife and meets his grown-up son, who is responsible for managing the family's plantations. The narrator struggles with the language barrier but quickly improves his Portuguese through practice. After spending three months with his family, he considers revisiting his island with his son and Friday. They plan the journey and set sail, making a stop at the island. However, they discover that the prisoners are no longer there, and it is unknown what happened to them. The narrator is relieved to learn that Friday's people do not eat Europeans. He decides to stay on the island with his son while the captain agrees to take them back to Brazil on the return journey. The narrator is fascinated by the changes on the island and the presence of many people.
