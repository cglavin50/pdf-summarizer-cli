They inform the men on the ship that they were unable to find the missing sailors. Once all the men are on the ship, the captain reveals himself and the attack begins. There are injuries and one person is killed, the second leader of the rebellion. The captain regains control of the ship and returns to the island, informing the narrator that the ship is now under his control. The narrator is overjoyed and cries tears of happiness. After celebrating their victory and the narrator's departure from the island, they discuss what to do with the five prisoners the captain doesn't trust. The captain decides to give the prisoners the choice to stay on the island or face death in England. The prisoners choose to stay and are placed in a cave, which now serves as the prison. The narrator then prepares for his journey, taking his dog, parrot, book, and valuable items from the ships. He meets with the prisoners again, showing them his corn and animals, and tells them about the island. They leave the island in December 1686 and first visit the island where Friday's people live.

He then returns to his town, York, where he finds some living relatives who are happy to see him. Friday finds England to be a fascinating and new experience, although he dislikes the cold weather. The narrator assures him that the weather will be better in the summer. In May, the narrator receives a letter and gifts from his wife in Brazil. She informs him that she remarried after believing he was dead but her new husband has since passed away. She also reveals that they have a son who wishes to meet his father. Overwhelmed with emotion, the narrator ponders his next steps. The narrator decides to visit his wife and son in Brazil, and after a successful visit, he plans to return to his island with his son and the captain. However, upon arriving at the island, they discover that the prisoners are no longer there. The narrator's son expresses a desire to stay on the island, but the narrator convinces him to return to Brazil. They arrange for the captain to take them back to Brazil on the return journey. The narrator is pleased to see the island thriving with Friday's people and decides to stay on the island, while his son and the captain return to Brazil.
